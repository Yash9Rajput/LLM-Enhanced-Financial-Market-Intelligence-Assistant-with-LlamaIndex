# LLM-Enhanced-Financial-Market-Intelligence-Assistant-with-LlamaIndex

This project builds an **intelligent financial market analysis assistant** powered by **LlamaIndex**, **LangChain**, and **Hugging Face models**.  
It leverages **large language models (LLMs)** to process, index, and analyze financial datasets, providing insights and decision support for stock market research.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 Integration with **LlamaIndex** for efficient data ingestion & indexing  
- 🤖 **LLM-powered Q&A** over financial datasets  
- 📊 Stock market intelligence and contextual analysis  
- ⚡ GPU acceleration with PyTorch + Transformers  
- 🧩 Hugging Face embeddings + LangChain pipelines
